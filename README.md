# Machine-Learning-C++

The C++ code in this repository is a hopfully accurate port of the python code in Michael Nielsen's book 
[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). Just as the original Python
code requires the Numpy library to do linear algebra, the C++ uses the ublas library from [boost](http://www.boost.org)
for the matrix manipulation.

I recommend you read the Micheal Nielson's book and if you wish to use C++ rather than python you can use the code
in this repository to supplement your understanding. I would like to thank Grant Sanderson, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/featured) 
for his entertaining and educational videos on [Machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=68s) and
for introducing me to Michael's book.
If you're new to Machine learning I can also recommend as a excelent introduction
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) 
by Stanford University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).
